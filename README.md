Indic Keyboard is a MOSS Award winning, privacy aware versatile keyboard for Android users who wish to use Indic and Indian languages to type messages, compose emails and generally prefer to use them in addition to English on their phone. You can use this application to type anywhere in your phone that you would normally type in English. It currently supports 23 languages and 57 layouts.

## How is it privacy aware ?

We do not collect or store any information via the app. Infact, we did go one step ahead and removed the Internet permission. Indic Keyboard is one of the safest way to type even in English language.

## Will my phone support it ?

Indic keyboard supports Android version 4.1 and above. If you can see your language in its native script below, you should be able to install and use it.

Some devices may not support all the languages listed since the device manufacturer didn't ship necessary fonts. For older versions of Android, even when necessary fonts are there, rendering for some of the languages is not perfect. This is some thing which we can't fix from application side.

# What is a keyboard layout ?

Indic keyboard provides multiple "keyboard layouts". This means that you will have different ways to type in your native language.

Transliteration allows you to type out words using English characters, but will automatically transform the words to your native language. For example, if you type "namaste" in English while using Devanagari transliteration keyboard, it will transform it to नमस्ते correctly.

Inscript layout is the standardized keyboard that Government of India came up with to cater for the majority of the languages in India. We support the full specification, and if you are already familiar with Inscript on your Desktop, it will work on the phone too.

Phonetic Keyboard lays characters in the similiar sounding position of the Latin characters. For example, the location where 'A' in placed in QWERTY layout, a similiar sounding 'അ' can be seen in case of Malayalam. This actually helps users who likes to type seeing their native characters, locating and learning will be easier.

Compact Keyboard allows to type Indian languages without the shift key. You can long press on the letters to get more options. Goal is to try and fit all characters without a second layer of characters.

There are some other layouts as well, specific to the languages - do try them out.
